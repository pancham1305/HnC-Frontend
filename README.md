- To help people in time of emergency.
- To ensure that services are being provided as per their problem at the earliest.
- Relieve people from lengthy queues and Time exhausting Process of Registration and waiting.

## Methodology

- We use **Geoapify API** to search for the nearest hospital as per user's coordinates.
- We are providing an emergency button to directly contact to nearest hospital which can provide the required services.
- We are providing an online form of the hospitals so that user can remotely register for any appointment/tests/scans/checkups without wasting their precious time.
- We plan to make an interface where people can compare the prices and services of different hospitals so that they can choose hospital as per their need.
-  We plan to use google's rating system to arrange hospitals as per quality of their services and distance from the user.

## Results

- According to a research made by ResearchGate an average indian spends approximately 2.18 hours after entering an health organisation and before getting attended by a specific doctor, we have minimised this time by organising all the paperwork on our website so that people can save this precious time.

- According to the advocacies done by RADHEE in collaboration with MORTH - Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, it was found out that Every day in India, 24,012 patients die due to delay in getting medical help as ambulances are delayed due to traffic. So, in order to minimize the number of deaths we have included an emergency button feature on our website that will be responsible for alerting the nearest hospital having the required services.
