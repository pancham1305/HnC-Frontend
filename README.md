# HnC-Frontend
This is an online web application that will assist the users to find the best hospitality services near them.
This application uses:
a) HTML & CSS --- To develop the FrontEnd of the website
b) JavaScript --- To react according to the inputs entered by the user.
c) NodeJS --- Used to implement various functionalities in the FronEnd and BackEnd part of the website.
d) MongoDB --- Used to store the database of our website
e) GeoApify --- Locates the nearby healthcare centers/hospitals and To search for different hospitals given a query parameter.
f) Navigator API --- This API gives the coordinates of the user.
g) ExpressJS --- Backend framework used for api handling such as get and post requests.

The most useful feature of this web application is that people will be able to compare the facilities provided by the hositals near them on various parameters such as Fees Taken, Vacancy, Slots Available, Distance etc. This will not only help them in choosing the best facility available but also will save their crucial time in case of an Emergency. We are also worrking on the Emergency Feature that will help the patients to call the ambulance from the hospital nearest to them by JUST ONE CLICK!!!. We will be adding this feature at the earliest.
